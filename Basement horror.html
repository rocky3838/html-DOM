    <h1>The Basement</h1>
    <p id="story">The house had been silent for hours, except for the occasional groan of aging wood and the distant rumble of thunder
    outside. I hadn’t meant to go down there—not tonight. But something felt off. The air upstairs had grown heavy, like the
    walls were holding their breath.
    
    I gripped the flashlight tighter, its plastic casing slick in my sweaty palm, and stepped onto the basement stairs. Each
    creaking board beneath me sounded louder than the last, echoing into the shadows below. The deeper I went, the colder it
    got. Not just chilly—unnatural. Like the kind of cold that clings to your bones and whispers secrets you don’t want to
    hear.
    
    The beam of light danced across the cluttered basement—old furniture, broken boxes, a rusted bicycle. I called out
    softly, “Aarav?” My voice barely made it past my lips. No answer.</p>

            document.getElementById("story").innerHTML = "it turned out to be a prank that my brother (Aarav) had set up. He jumped out from behind the old furnace, laughing hysterically. I was so relieved, but also a bit annoyed. The basement was just a dusty storage space after all, nothing to be afraid of. But the thrill of the moment was unforgettable. I laughed it off, but I knew I would never look at that basement the same way again. The shadows seemed to linger a little longer, and the creaks of the old house felt a bit more ominous and maybe, just maybe, there is something down there that I just haven't found yet. The basement, once a place of mundane storage, had transformed into a realm of mystery and unease, forever etched in my memory.";
